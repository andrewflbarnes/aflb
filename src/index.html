                  A capable and passionate software developer, Andrew has over 8 years of experience building,
                  designing, integrating and supporting
                  high-volume, high-availability, fault-tolerant, national scale payments systems both in the UK and

                  Strong communication skills and ability to present technical solutions and challenges to both
                  technical and non-technical people mean
                  he frequently runs KT sessions within the organisation and also presents technical demos to senior
                  level customer staff.

                <p>
                  A versatile individual, Andrew possesses a great enthusiasm for learning new (and old!) systems and
                  technologies, both for his own
                  enjoyment as well as to better understand the software development landscape, its history and its
                  future.

                  Andrew is motivated to deliver high quality, maintainable, clean, robust and vulnerability free code
                  and platforms which can be readily
                  supported and continuously improved across a lifespan of many years if not decades.

                <p>
                  He prefers to do things correctly rather than quickly and endeavours to understand how and why things
                  work, not just what works. This drive
                  and ethos means he measures success not just by the robustness, impact and overall success of
                  deliveries, but also the ease and ability
                  with which engineers can maintain, improve, expand, innovate and test them.

                  for key management and message initiation. This became the defacto TCP/IP 8583 simulator deployed into
