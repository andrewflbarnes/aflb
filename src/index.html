                  A capable and passionate software developer, Andrew has over 8 years of experience building, designing, integrating and supporting
                  high-volume, high-availability, fault-tolerant, national scale payments systems both in the UK and internationally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Strong communication skills and ability to present technical solutions and challenges to both technical and non-technical people mean
                  he frequently runs KT sessions within the organisation and also presents technical demos to senior level customer staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A versatile individual, Andrew possesses a great enthusiasm for learning new (and old!) systems and technologies, both for his own
                  enjoyment as well as to better understand the software development landscape, it's history and it's future.

                  Andrew is motivated to deliver high quality, maintainable, clean, robust and vulnerability free code and platforms which can be readily
                  supported and continuously improved across a lifespan of many years if not decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He prefers to do things correctly rather than quickly and endeavours to understand how and why things work, not just what works. This drive
                  and ethos means he measures success not just by the robustness, impact and overall success of deliveries, but also the ease and ability
                  with which engineers can maintain, improve, expand, innovate and test them.
