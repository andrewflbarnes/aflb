A minimal static website designed to host my CV and (in the future) support a contact page or modal.

There is also a sticky footer with a link to GitHub.

### Motivation

I need somewhere to keep track of my CV and this seems like a good enough place to do it (version control, yay) but also means I can host in online.

The downside is it's not easily converatable to PDF/doc formats (maybe I'll change thatat some point...).

### Local deployment

Run the build script (pretty sure I don't need this anymore!) then open static/index.html in your favourite browser - simples :)
